# East End-syntax theme

A light flowery theme.

The East End syntax is designed for the [East End ui theme](https://atom.io/themes/east-end-ui) .

The idea is to have, together with the UI theme a GUI that is easily readable on a notebook in many light conditions.

The syntax theme is based on the [One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) syntax has and the same special highlight support for C, Cpp, C#, CSS, Elixir, gfm, Go, Java, Javascript, Json, PHP, Phyton and Ruby. 
The colors are inspired by the [Pear](https://github.com/Niishi/pear-syntax) syntax theme.
